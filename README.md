## Description

The purpose of this project was to work as a group to utilze many of the technologies we have learned over the past few months to create a full stack MERN application. Early on in our planning process we decided to develop a fun dating application that would match you up with your "Soul Mates" based on your interests and give the users a fun place to meet up using a Google Maps API. 

## Installation

To install NPM packages.
- npm install

To run locally.
- npm run develop

## Usage

- When you click on the link below to take you to The Dating Mapp application. 
- You will be then directed to the home page where you can click the "Get Started" link, or if you have already signed up you can click the "Login" link. 
- The "Get Started" link directs you to the signup page where you need to fill out all of your information as well as answering the questions by choosing options from the drop down menus. 
- You will then be taken to the "Get Connected" page where you will be matched with your "Soul Mates" and given a fun place to meet up.
